Advanced Master of AI thesis on marine litter detection

### NOTE:
DINO and STEGO frameworks have been adapted to work in Colab and to run this thesis experiments. Their actual source code can be found at:

- DINO: https://github.com/facebookresearch/dino.git
- STEGO: https://github.com/mhamilton723/STEGO.git

Both the repository and code are still being cleaned and updated. More code can be found in the ```development``` branch.
